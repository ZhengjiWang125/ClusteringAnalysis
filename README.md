# ClusteringAnalysis

This is for my internship.

The goal is to do clustering on potentail buyer by focusing on the features in the excel file. And also do analysis on each clustering group.

The things I did:

1. Clean the Dataset, check the correlation between features

2. PCA, one hot encoding

3. Use elbow method and K-means.

4. Simple analysis and visualization on each clustering group.
